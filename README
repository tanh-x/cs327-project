[ Generation algorithm documentation ]
The generation consists of three phases:
- Sampling from 3D voronoi noise
- Blend and distort the terrain to make it more natural
- Place roads and buildings

1. First pass: Voronoi noise
    20 points of each of the 4 types (short/tall grass, boulder, water) are
    scattered uniformly in 3D space. Initial terrain types are then generated
    by sampling the corresponding voronoi diagram, i.e., the closest point will
    determine the type of terrain at that cell. The sampling point has a small
    random factor to make the terrain more natural.

    The 3rd dimension allows for smooth tweaks of the terrain by sliding along
    the z-axis, as opposed to using a new seed, which will always generate a 
    completely different terrain map.

    Since the y-axis covers more space than the x-axis (text is tall, rather
    than wide), the coordinate space is also scaled accordingly to minimize
    distortion.

    This first pass will define overall shape of the terrain, but the appearance
    will be similar to that of a voronoi diagram, which is too geometric. We
    need further processing to make the terrain more natural

2. Second pass: "Biome blending" / quasi cellular automaton
    Choose one tile at random ("pivot point"), and consider the neighborhood of
    12 adjacent points whose taxicab distance is less than 2 from the pivot.
    These points have a chance to be converted to a different type, whose rules
    depend on the type of the pivot and the type of the current point. This can
    be thought of as a cellular automaton system. For more details, see the
    biome blending rules section.

    Once we're done, with ~80% probability, continue the process by moving the
    pivot along a random direction by a random amount (0-2 tiles). However, we
    keep the pivot type of the original one. This allows some chosen tiles to
    have a far-reaching influence. Repeat until we hit the ~20% stop condition.

    Do this process for 64-80 pivot points, (chosen randomly with replacement).

3. Third pass: Road and buildings
    Road traversal start from the left and top. For the horizontal road, every
    step, the road traverses to the right by 1 tile, and goes up/down by `dy`
    tiles. `dy` is initially 0, but for every step, a random "kick" is applied
    to `dy`. We don't want our paths to be jagged, so `dy` has a "momentum"
    factor. Finally, `dy` is also biased by a "drift" factor that pulls the path
    towards the gate on the other side. The closer we are to the eastern border,
    the stronger the drift factor. A similar process is done for the vertical.

    For buildings, a random point on a road is chosen prior to road generation.
    During generation, we know that the road will bend towards `dy` (or `dy`),
    so we place buildings 1-3 tiles away on the other direction, `-dy`, then we
    connect the building to the main road with a simple straight path.


[Biome blending rules]
All these rules are applied for each of the 12 neighboring tiles independently.
In other words, we reroll, check, and convert for each tile separately.

Boulder pivot: 
    Boulders may sprout nearby tall grass or water tiles into trees, with a 50%
    probability. Otherwise, it has a 4.52% probability to convert any tile to
    another boulder.

Water pivot:
    Each nearby boulder tile has a 68.5% chance to be eroded, becoming water.

Tall grass pivot:
    A tall grass have a 20.8% chance of converting neighboring tall grass or
    water tiles to sprout a new tree. If this fails, it is guaranteed to convert
    neighboring water or boulders tiles to tall grass. Neighboring short grass
    tiles might also be grown to tall grass, with 86.2% probability.

Short grass pivot:
    Short grass has a 60% chance to grow into nearby tall grass or water tiles.

Tree pivot:
    A tree can spread to any neighboring tiles, with 16.2% probability, or 22.1%
    probability if it's a short/tall grass tile. If this succeeds, the tile will
    be converted to a tree. Otherwise, it is converted to tall grass. So, while
    trees are rare, they can spread plants very well.
